## List Of Pride
A non exhaustive list of projects and people that are generally awesome in the Minecraft community.

* [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper), "The sweet spot of stability and speed." - The best Minecraft server software out there in terms of quality.
* [Kashike](https://github.com/kashike), "Might have created Minecraft." - He's been involved in like half of the successful Minecraft projects, and we love him for that.

## Disclaimer
The people and projects listed here do not mean they are *objectively* good, but rather that a handful of people believe they are cool.
