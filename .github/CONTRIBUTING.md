There are a a couple of simple rules you need to follow when creating new entries.

## Style
Follow the style of `[<Project name>](<URL>), "<Amended, quirky quote by the project itself>" - <Short, quirky description/example of righteousness>.`

An example of this would be:\
`[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), "LEGO 2.0" - Lovely block game that has survived for a decade somehow.`\
-> [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), "LEGO 2.0" - Lovely block game that has survived for a decade somehow.

## Be sane
Don't include unfounded statements.

## Preferably, don't manage the project
A source really shines when someone outside of the project's management appreciates it.
